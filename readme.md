# 4 Bit Adder
    &esmp; This project was a an implementation of a 4 bit adder with a common-use Arduino module, 
the LCD monitor to display addition calculations of 4 bit binaries quickly using simple
Arduino code. This is a special project that started off of coding journey in my Junior 
year in high school, which was a fun combination of hardware and circuit design with 
dealing with the LCD API and signal to microcontroller handling. Within this repo
is my src code for the Arduino Microcontroller dealing with every possible combination
using a plethora of if/else clauses (Common bad habit of a new programmer). Linked
below is a Instructables link I created where I explain the project in higher detail,
with pictures of circuit diagrams and the process of circuit building from the start 
to finish.
